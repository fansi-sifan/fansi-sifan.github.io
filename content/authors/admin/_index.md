Hi! I'm Sifan Liu, experienced data scientist and strategic thinker with a unique blend of technical acumen, policy research, and business insights. Guided by my ongoing commitment to understanding and shaping the societal impact of emerging technologies, my journey has led me to study the geography of AI innovation, to consult for city governments on economic development, and to use data-driven strategies to transform startup ecosystems.

I co-founded [Data Whale](https://www.data-whale.com/), a team providing data-driven policy analysis in education, regional economy, health care, international development and beyond.
